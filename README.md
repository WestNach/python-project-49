## About this project

This is a set of 5 games for your brain.

## Games:

- Even or not
- Calculator
- Greatest common divisor
- Progression
- Prime number

#### Even or not

You will be given a number. You need to answer whether it is [even](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics)) or not.
Answer "yes" if given number is even, otherwise "no".
